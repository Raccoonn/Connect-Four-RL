# Connect-Four-RL
Connect Four Reinforcement Learning with environment and tkinter GUI



Connect Four environment, RL Agent, and tkinter game GUI.
  
  - Incorporated agents into GUI
    - Each step the associated agent will display its prediction
   
  - Player has complete control over move selection, ability to override prediction
  




GUI Credit to https://github.com/romainvause/
  - I found his repo and adapted most of the GUI
  - Next I want to combine the GUI with the RL agent for an interactive 2 player game



NOTES:

  - Currently just having fun with this to see if I can beat my friends
  - Working on training and modifying the environment for better results
  - WIll upload a trained network when I have made some progress
